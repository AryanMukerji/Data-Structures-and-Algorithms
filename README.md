## Welcome to Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ :clipboard:

This Repository was made to maintain various Algorithms in C++ in a single space.
This Repository is maintained by Sarthak1306
This a public Repository and all sorts of contributions to the code are welcomed.


## Steps to follow :scroll:

### 1. Fork it :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of [Data-Structures-and-Algorithms](https://github.com/Sarthak1306/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms) by using the <a> <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd></a> button

### 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
```
> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

### 3. Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to make a contribution. Please create a new branch using the command below  and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name <branchname> and switch to branch <branchname>
$ git checkout -b <branchname>
```

To switch to desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout <branchname>
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m "relevant message"
```

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin <branchname>
```

Finally, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.
